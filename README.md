This is an example of a react website that I build to improve my abilities in React, and almost every day, I fix its bugs, upgrade it, and add new components to it, such as a calendar, calculator, notes and other things you see. So don't expect much from it! I know that I am always at the beginning of the journey, and that's why I learn new things every day. This work can also be used as my resume, so I make it manageable!
